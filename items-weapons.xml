    <description>
      <p>The Living Sands are ancient magic with a will of their own, allowing merchants to traverse its expanses or snuffing them out with storm and choking dust seemingly on a whim. Once attuned to this sand, it will obey you until you fail three death saves or you un-attune to it. You can use it to make a ranged attack against a single creature 10 feet away using Strength or Dexterity, dealing 1d10 Bludgeoning, Slashing, or Piercing damage.</p>
      <p>Blinding Sand - Whenever you hit a creature with Living Sand, you may use a bonus action to turn it into a blinding blast. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the start of their next turn. This can be done 3 times and then cannot be done again until you take a long rest.</p>
      <p>Armor of Sand - As a bonus action, you can create a fine layer of sand to cover you, which you can harden into a second skin. You gain temporary hit points equal to your total level plus your Dexterity or Strength Modifier. While you have these temporary hit points, you gain resistance to fire damage. You regain the use of this ability after a short or long rest.</p>
      <p>Sword of the Dervish - As a bonus action, you can create a scimitar made of sand and air that seems to shift and swirl as your swing it.</p>
      <p>10 Charges (Spell DC: 15 and Attack: +7) (Regain charges at dawn - 1d4 + 2):
      <ul>
        <li>Fog cloud - 1 charge</li>
        <li>Earth tremor - 1 charge</li>
        <li>Maximilian's earthen grasp - 2 charges</li>
        <li>Pass without Trace - 2 charges</li>
        <li>Wall of sand - 3 charges</li>
        <li>Erupting earth - 3 charges</li>

    <description>
      <p>This midnight black revolver has an unsettling darkness to it - even though it never gets dirty, always maintaining a pristine polished appearance, light refuses to reflect off its surface. Upon closer inspection, its mechanisms make no sense at all - its cylinder has no chambers for holding cartridges, and there is no way to load it.</p>
      <p>Death Shot. While you are wielding Black Death, you can use your action to fire it. When you do so, a 300-foot long line of black energy that is 1 foot wide erupts from the gun, tearing apart everything in its path. All nonmagical objects are automatically obliterated. Magical objects that are not artifacts are disabled for one minute as if it was within an antimagic field. All creatures in the line must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. They take 10d10 force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. If this damage reduces a target to 0 hit points, it is destroyed, leaving no remains. After you fire black death, it continually smokes for 1 minute, during which it cannot be fired again.</p>

    <description>
      <p>This dagger is 15 inches long from the hilt to the tip. the blade itself is a milky white color and is extremely sharp double edged blade (or single edged, the blade comes in many shapes). You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
      <p>The Dagger of Memories has the following properties:
        <ul>
          <li>While attuned to the artifact, you cannot be charmed or frightened</li>
          <li>While attuned to the artifact, your walking speed increases by 10 ft.</li>
          <li>While attuned to the artifact, nonmagical flames are extinguished within 30 ft of you</li>
          <li>Creatures with a challenge rating of 0, as well as plants that aren't creatures, drop to 0 hit points when within 10ft of the artifact</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>While this weapon is in your possession, you have proficiency on Stealth checks. If you already have proficiency in Stealth, double your proficiency bonus.</p>
      <p>Memory Sleuth: Upon slicing a target, wielder gains the memories of the last 2 hours of the target. The target cannot resist their memories being taken through their blood as long as they are alive. This feature does not affect undead creatures.</p>
      <p>Absorb Memories: If an attack from the Dagger of Memories brings a creature to 0 hit points, all blood is drunk by the dagger and all the target's memories since birth are stored in the blade. The wielder must make a Wisdom save (DC 14) when this happens or be taken over for 12 hours as they are overwhelmed by the memories they have stolen.</p>
      <p>Recall: If the dagger is merely plunged into a target and drawn immediately, then wielder gains the memories of the target from the last 2 days. But this is all at the DM'S discretion as to how long ago in the targets past the blade sees from drinking their blood, and how much blood is required. Also up to the DM is how long the memories stay intact inside the blade.</p>

    <description>
      <p>This dagger appears to be made of an amalgamation of various metals welded together with no particular style, making it look like many different daggers were broken up and put back together to make it.
This dagger's blade is vicious in shape after years of being battered and used and causes deep, painful wounds. Every time this dagger successfully lands a hit, the target takes 1d4 damage at the start of its turn from blood loss, with every additional hit adding another d4 to this damage to a maximum of 10d4 damage.</p>
      <p>This dagger's handle is oddly shaped and is impossible to be held properly by anyone other than Emmett himself. Anyone who does not wear the Ring of Stars is not considered proficient with this dagger. In addition, this dagger vibrates painfully in the hand of its wielder, giving them disadvantage to hit and gives enemies advantage to disarm the wielder without the ring equipped.</p>
      <p>The Patchwork Dagger has the following properties:
        <ul>
          <li>While attuned to the artifact, you gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class</li>
          <li>While attuned to the artifact, you have resistance against necrotic damage</li>
          <li>While attuned to the artifact, you regain 1d6 hit points at the start of your turn if you have at least 1 hit point</li>
          <li>While attuned to the artifact, you have disadvantage on saving throws against spells</li>
          <li>While you are attuned to the artifact, your flaw is amplified in a way determined by the DM</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Destroying the Patchwork Dagger. This dagger's preservation magic is tied to the Ring of Stars, if this dagger is used on the ring, both items are permanently destroyed via disintegration.</p>

      <p>Consecutive Shitter: When you hit an enemy two consecutive times with this weapon, the target must make a constitution saving throw at a DC of 15, on a failed save, this enemy cannot move or take any actions, bonus actions or reactions and take 1d4 poison damage. They repeat this save at the beginning of their next turn until they succeed at the saving throw.</p>
      <p>Diarrhea: When an enemy is suffering from Consecutive Shitter, if you hit the same enemy with another 2 consecutive hits, their damage is increased by 1d4 and the DC of their save is increased by 1.</p>
      <p>Dysentery: When you roll a crtical hit on an enemey, they get poisoned.</p>

    <description>
      <p>This slim blade was forged using strange, unearthly metals from a meteorite. When you use an action to toss this magic dagger into the air, it orbits your body at a distance of 1d3 feet. Another creature can use an action to grasp the dagger to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and either wield or stow the dagger.</p>
      <p>When you take the Attack action while the dagger is orbiting you, you can use a bonus action to cause the dagger to attack a target within 10 feet of you. The dagger uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage rolls. Immediately after the attack, the dagger returns to orbit you.</p>
      <p>In addition, the dagger creates a small gravitational field that wards off harm. While the dagger orbits you, when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + 4. If the damage is reduced to 0, the missile slows to a stop without hitting you and falls to the ground at your feet.</p>

    <description>
      <p>This dagger employs the rippling energy of tremors to find the kill on its targets. It has 3 charges that are recovered every day at dawn.</p>
      <p>Rippling Burst: Ripple steel distorts to produce thunderous bursts: when you hit a target with this dagger, you can expend 1 charge to cause 1d6 extra thunder damage, no action required.</p>
      <p>Tectonic Jumble: The dagger transfers the ripple to locked objects to pry them open. You can touch an object and expend 2 charges to cast knock on it. The spell cast in this way has no effect on objects affected by arcane lock.</p>
      <p>Deep Ripple: While attuned to this dagger, your sneak attack feature can be enhanced: whenever you deal extra damage with it using this dagger, you can use a bonus action and expend 2 charges to deal an additional 2d6 thunder damage to the target.</p>

    <description>
      <p>Gifted by the murder, this dagger's pommel is decorated by a different trinket whenever it's unsheathed - shiny rocks, pieces of metal or colored glass shards are the most common finds. I t has 3 charges that are regained every day at dusk.</p>
      <p>Birds of a Feather: When you make an attack with Murder of Crows, you can summon a spectral copy of it on your other hand. This copy disappears at the start of your next turn (or before is you wish to). Additionally, you can expend 1 charge when you make a ranged attack with the original to summon it back to your hand.</p>
      <p>Sharp Beaks and Claws: When you make an attack with Murder or Crows, you can spend a number of charges so the Murder aids you. You deal an extra 1d6 slashing damage per charge on a hit and you score a critical hit on a number lower than 20 per charge expended. However, your critical failure is raised in the same way and you suffer 1d6 + Dexterity modifier slashing damage on  such a failure.</p>

    <description>
      <p>These blades mimic the balance between two stars the circle around each other, the perfect pair for ambidextrous warrios. They have 3 charges that are recovered every day at dawn. Due to their twinned nature, attuning to both only counts at attuning to one item</p>
      <p>Twinned Pull: The Twin Stars attract each other: while having one of the blades in one hand and the other one being in the same plane of existence as you, you can summon it to your other hand requiring no action. You need to expend 1 charge in case the other blade is more than 100 ft. away.</p>
      <p>Twofold Brilliance: The blade work better together: when you make a main and a bonus attack with the Twin Stars using two-weapon fighting adn hit them both in the same turn, you deal an extra 1d6 radiant damage on the bonus attack. Additionally, you can expend 1 charge and use a reaction to try and blind the target of the bonus attack: they must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of their next turn.</p>

    <description>
      <p>Areadbhar is a magical weapon forged ages ago. It's creator is unknown, but it is sometimes known as "The Slaughterer". It thirsts for blood and souls, feasting on the user's soul if it is not tempered with enough death.</p>
      <p>The Areadbhar has the following properties:
        <ul>
          <li>While attuned to the artifact, you have resistance against fire damage.</li>
          <li>While attuned to the artifact, you can use an action to cast one 3rd-level spell (chosen by the DM) from it. After you cast the spell, roll a d6. On a roll of 1-5, you can't cast it again until the next dawn.</li>
          <li>While attuned to the artifact, you can use an action to cast one cantrip (chosen by the DM) from it.</li>
          <li>While attuned to the artifact, all holy water with in 10 feet of you is destroyed.</li>
          <li>While attuned to the artifact, you have disadvantage on saving throws against spells.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Magic Weapon: Areadbhar is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p>
      <p>Devour Soul: Whenever you use it to reduce a creature to 0 hit points, the spear slays the creature and devours its soul, unless it is a construct or an undead. A creature whose soul has been devoured by Areadbhar can be restored to life only by a wish spell. When it devours a soul, Areadbhar grants you temporary hit points equal to the slain creature's hit point maximum. These hit points fade after 24 hours. As long as these temporary hit points last and you keep Areadbhar in your hand, you have advantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks.</p>
      <p>If you die while attuned to Areadbhar, the spear devours your soul.</p>

    <description>
      <p>During the reign of the magister Rael, a young druid woman lived her life in the forests of her homeland. Rarely would this druid concern herself with the machinations of the "civilized" peoples of her home nation. Her life was quiet, peaceful and perfect. One day, however, a great storm began to ravage the land, and young Wick Pinewood was forced to leave her beloved forests to seek out the source of the storm. On her quest, she saw the great suffering inflicted by the wrathful queen Rael, and did what she could to ease the suffering of those harmed by the Storm Queen. Through willpower and determination, Wick reached the Golden Court and did battle with Rael, narrowly escaping with her life, but successfully slaying the wicked queen. Only her heart remained...</p>
      <p>Upon Wick's death, her blood was drained from her body and kept in a cistern in a hidden grove. To attune to this item, one must imbibe the blood in its entirety. This causes the blood to bind itself to the one who ingests it, keeping them attuned until death. If a neutral creature imbibes the blood, they become violently ill and evacuate the blood from their body. If an evil creature imbibes the blood, they become violently ill and suffer internal damage, taking 12d6 points of poison damage that ignores immunity and resistance and can not be reduced in any way. If the blood is removed from the veins of the attuned creature, they die.</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>While attuned to the artifact, you can use an action to cast one 2nd-level spell (chosen by the DM) from it. After you cast the spell, roll a d6. On a roll of 1-5, you can't cast it again until the next dawn.</li>
          <li>While attuned to the artifact, you can use an action to cast one cantrip (chosen by the DM) from it. After you cast the spell, roll a d6. On a roll of 1-5, you can't cast it again until the next dawn.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Aspect of the Druid (Curse): While attuned to this item, while not in a cave, coastline (or at sea), field, forest, or grove, you suffer disadvantage on spell attack rolls and saving throws against your spells are made at advantage.</p>
      <p>Heroism Within the Vein: While attuned to this item, you become immune to poison damage, the poisoned condition, and disease.</p>
      <p>Pinewood's Blessing: While attuned to this item, you gain the ability to cast cure wounds as a 1st level spell. When casting cure wounds in this way, you use your Wisdom as your spellcasting ability. You may cast cure wounds in this way four times. Pinewood's Blood regains all expended uses at dawn.</p>
      <p>Wisdom of the Wilds: While attuned to this item, your Wisdom score increases by 2 to a maximum of 24.</p>
      <p>Destroying the Pinewood's Blood: Pinewood's Blood may only be destroyed if a creature attuned to Rael's Heart slays the creature attuned to Pinewood's Blood.</p>

  <element name="Planeshift Sword" type="Magic Item" source="Homebrew Collection" id="ID_WOTC_DND_WIKI_PLANESHIFT_SWORDS">
    <description>
      <p>The Planeshift Swords are a pair of blades which initially resemble shortswords. The blades harness the energy created by tension and friction between realms, with their striking energy drawn from the same energy as planar rift magic. Having been forged from the remains of the first planar gate and imbued with its energies, the swords present a fairly unique combat potential. The blades themselves don't appear to be of any intrigue until attuned. While activated, the Planeshift Sword's physical blades will melt and evaporate, becoming near-ethereal wispy blades of energy.</p>
      <p>Magic Weapon: The Planeshift Swords are a inseparable pair of magical weapons that grant +3 to attack and damage rolls with them.</p>
      <p>Alignment: The color of the energy blade depends on your alignment, and affects the energy of the blade. LG: White. NG: Yellow. CG: Green... LN: Orange. TN: Silver/Grey. CN: Blue... LE: Red. NE: Purple. CE: Black. The vibrancy of color is up to the player or DM. Neutral alignment players with a significant moral leaning may wish to add a reddish tint (If more evil) or a yellowish tint (If more good)for the sake of personal identification.</p>
      <p>Attuned Acumen: When the blades are attuned and activated, the wielder may use their Wisdom modifier in the place of their Dexterity modifier when rolling to hit or damage. When deactivated or powerless, this is inapplicable.</p>
      <p>Planar Energy Strikes: When the blades are attuned and activated, any attack made with them creates a directional wave of pure energy which affects a 55ft long by 5ft wide line. The wave travels through creatures to the target but not through walls. For the purpose of determining its effect on wards and magical/nonmagical barriers, it can be considered a spell of Forcewave. The attack deals 1d6 magic damage, ignoring any magic resistance or immunity. The targeted enemy and enemies between them and the player must attempt a Strength save of DC 8 + Your Proficiency + Your Dexterity or Wisdom Modifier. On a failed save, they take an additional 2d6 force damage, are pushed 10 feet, and knocked prone. On a successful save, they take half damage.</p>
      <p>At Arm's Length: While activated, attacks against enemies within 5 feet have disadvantage.</p>
      <p>Plane Shift: The blades may be held together in the shape of an X to create a 5' x 5' planar gate directly in front of the caster. This takes 1 full turn of concentration to activate, and requires a Wisdom check of DC20 - the character's level (Divided by 2). On a success, the gate leads to a location of the caster's choice. On a failure, the gate leads to a random location on a plane determined by the DM. The gate may be held open for a maximum of 3 turns, after which point the caster is left behind. Once the gate is closed, the swords become powerless/deactivated for 1d4 days and the player takes levels of exhaustion equal to the roll. For each full turn the gate was held open, add 1 to the 1d4 roll. While powerless, the swords are still considered magical weapons when identified by spells, but are functionally regular Shortswords. There is a 33% chance Plane Shift can never be cast again by these blades. (Note: Differs from the Plane Shift spell, up to 8 creatures and the caster may enter the gate at will without requiring physical contact with one another.)</p>
      <p>Precision Cut. An enemy killed by the force wave of these blades is effectively bisected, as well as whatever clothing or armor they were wearing.</p>
      <p>The Planeshift Swords has the following properties:
        <ul>
          <li>While attuned to the artifact, you gain proficiency in one skill of the DM's choice.</li>
          <li>While attuned to the artifact, you can use an action to cast one 6th-level spell (chosen by the DM) from it. After you cast the spell, roll a d6. On a roll of 1-5, you can't cast it again until the next dawn.</li>
          <li>While attuned to the artifact, your weight increases by 10 pounds.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Destroying the Planeshift Swords. In order to destroy the Planeshift Swords, each sword must be simultaneously thrust through 2 separate planar gates leading to different planes. With ten minutes of concentration, their planar energy will be stripped of them, leaving behind two permanently powerless hilts. These may be smelted down into a nice necklace or simply tossed away.</p>

      <p>You throw a random card. The weapon damage, the bonuses to hit and damage, and range increase at higher levels.</p>
      <p><strong>Additional Effect</strong>: When you roll a 20 or above to hit with your Death Dealing Deck, your attack has an additional effect. The additional effect is determined by drawing a random card from a standard deck of playing/poker cards (leaving two jokers in the deck).

      <p><strong>A unique design</strong>: The cards of your Death Dealing Deck look like no other.</p>
      <p><strong>Do tell...</strong>: If the Detect Magic spell is cast on your Death Dealing Deck, it reveals its magic to be a mix of conjuration and abjuration.</p>
      <p><strong>A fresh deck...</strong> If lost, misplaced, or destroyed, an identical replacement deck (with all its previous perks) can be conjured by spending one hour playing cards in a tavern, pub, or gambling hall.</p>

      <p><strong>Hands off</strong>: In the hands of anyone other than the attuned roague, your Death Dealing Deck becomes a simple, non-magical deck of cards and disintegrates 10 minutes later. If the attuned rogue reclaims the Deck within those ten minutes, it instantly returns to its previous magical form.</p>

    <description>
      <p>Crafted by famed magical mercantile maestro Odius Plotz, this small hourglass has two charges.</p>
      <p>Turning over this hourglass, and using one charge allows friendly creatures within 30 feet (including yourself) to gain the benefits of a short rest in just 10 minutes of downtime. Using both charges grants friendly creatures within 30 feet (including yourself) the benefits of a long rest after just 30 minutes of downtime.</p>
      <p>After both charges are used, the hourglass crumbles to dust leaving behind a *10% off* coupon for your next purchase from Plotz Devices. The coupon includes fine print which is too small to read and may, in fact, not be a language at all.</p>

      <p>The card vanishes and a large, flying Card Shark appears where the thrown card landed. The Card Shark is friendly to you and your companions. It takes its turn immediately after yours in initiative order and will attack any target you choose. The Card Shark vanishes at the end of your next turn or if it is reduced to 0 hit points.</p>

      <p>This is a +1 sword of dazzling craftsmanship.</p>
      <p>Whenever you attack with the Sword of Gambling, before your roll to hit, you guess the number (1-20) you're about to roll. If you hit, and the number on your attack roll matches your guess, you do an additional 1d6 force damage (this additional damage is not doubled on a critical hit). And, yes, advantage on the roll doubles your chances to guess correctly!</p>

      <p>Unlike its relative, the Deck of Many Fates is a relatively new artifact, unknown to most. It contains a staggering 27 cards, each with a new power, curse, or opportunity. The Deck of Many Fates may be used on its own as an independent deck, or shuffled together with the Deck of Many Things to createa a 49 card hybrid of magic, terror, and destiny.</p>
